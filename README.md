Week-1 OPERATORS AND EVALUATION OF EXPRESSIONS

a.	Write a C program to check whether a number is even or odd using ternary operator.

b.	Write a C program to perform the addition of two numbers without using + operator.

c.	Write a C program to evaluate the arithmetic expression ((a + b / c * d - e) * (f - g)). Read the values a, b, c, d, e, f, g from the standard input device.

d.	Write a C program to find the sum of individual digits of a 3 digit number.

e.	Write a C program to read the values of x and y and print the results of the following expressions in one line: i.	(x + y) / (x - y) ii.	(x + y)(x - y)

Week-2 CONTROL STRUCTURES

a.	Write a C program to find the sum of individual digits of a positive integer.

b.	A Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first and second terms in the sequence are 0 and 1. Subsequent terms are found by adding the preceding two terms in the sequence. Write a C program to generate the first n terms of the sequence.

c.	Write a C program to generate all the prime numbers between 1 and n, where n is a value supplied by the user.

d.	A character is entered through keyboard. Write a C program to determine whether the character entered is a capital letter, a small case letter, a digit or a special symbol using if-else and switch case. The following table shows the range of ASCII values for various characters. Characters	ASCII values A – Z	65 – 90 a – z	97 – 122 0 – 9	48 – 57 Special symbols	0 – 47, 58 – 64, 91 – 96, 123 – 127

e. If cost price and selling price of an item is input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made profit or incurred loss. Write a C program to determine how much profit or loss incurred in percentage.

Week-3 CONTROL STRUCTURES

a. Write a C program, which takes two integer operands and one operator from the user, performs the operation and then prints the result. (Consider the operators +, -, *, /, % and use switch statement).

b.	Write a C program to calculate the following sum: sum = 1 – x2 /2! + x4 /4! – x6 /6! +x8 /8! – x10/10!

c.	Write a C program to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

d.	Write a C program to check whether a given 3 digit number is Armstrong number or not.

e.	Write a C program to print the numbers in triangular form

b. Write a C program to determine if the given string is a palindrome or not.

c. Write a C program to find a string within a sentence and replace it with another string.

d. Write a C program that reads a line of text and counts all occurrence of a particular word.

e. Write a C program that displays the position or index in the string S where the string T begins, or 1 if S doesn't contain T.

Week-6 FUNCTIONS

a.	Write C programs that use both recursive and non-recursive functions i.	To find the factorial of a given integer. ii.	To find the greatest common divisor of two given integers.

b.	Write C programs that use both recursive and non-recursive functions i.	To print Fibonacci series. ii.	To solve towers of Hanoi problem.

c.	Write a C program to print the transpose of a given matrix using function.
